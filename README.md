This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in React applications:  unhandled promise rejections during asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file shows a component making an API call.  Errors are caught, but the application doesn't provide any user feedback beyond a generic loading message which might persist indefinitely.  The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates how to improve this by using a more robust error handling strategy.  This includes logging errors for debugging and providing appropriate user feedback to inform the user about the issue.
